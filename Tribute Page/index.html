			<h2 class="font">Here's a time-line of Nana Okyere Kwagyan's life:</h2>
			<ul class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
				<br>
				<li><b>April 1991</b> - Born to a mother who is a trader in second-hand clothing and a father who is a driver at the University hospital in Ayigya, a suburb of Kumasi, he went on to attend the University basic school and later moved to Infant Jesus Lumen Cristi International School, which is a Roman Catholic missionary school in the province. He is the last born of his mother Victoria Ama Pokuah and last but one born of his father Ebenezer Kwame Amankwah. </li>
				<br>
				<li><b>May 1997</b> - Whilst waiting on his mom to make lunch for the family before he leaves with his siblings for a birthday party he decided to take a nap. Unfortunately, he woke up to a tragedy. In the middle of his sleep his mom called him to come and eat forgetting she had plugged in an electric coil heater to boil water near the foot of the sofa in which he slept. In an attempt to sit up before standing up, his feet went straight into the boiling water in the bucket. The joy in the day turned into wailing and cries for help. Luckily, a doctor visiting his wife with his junior doctor arrived and quickily took charge of the situation ensuring the little Nana Okyere Kwagyan was not damaged for life. Now the scar remains a visible mark on his feet but looks more like a birthmark than a healed wound. This accident took two years of his academic life.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b> September 2005</b> - In an attempt to undermine his education, his elderly sister and her husband moved him from Infant Jesus LC to a lower school, Revival International School, so he could take care of their kids for them. However this ended up as a blessing in disguise since that was the turning point of his educational life. He went on to become one of the best students in the school and earned the nickname "maths Teacher". He went on to pass the entrance exams into one of the best high schools in the nation named Opoku Ware School. There, he was awarded a sporting scholarship, went ahead to serve as the senior sports prefect. He served as the organiser of Wildlife fun club and Children's Right International. His time in high school was amazing. </li>
				<br>
				<li><b>September 2011</b> He gained admission to study at the University of Science and Technology, where he studied Geomatic Engineering. During his time at the university he was also managing his aunt's business. He served on various committees on campus. During his time at the university he was also commuting back and forth Spain which really affected his academics. Notably he was failed for not attending lectures for almost the whole term whilst stuck abroad. However, he went on to graduate successfully with second class honors. Also, he gained a whole lot of working experience through internship at GMT Land Surveys and Engineering C.L. There he worked on land demarcation, engineering survey projects, DBMS, Kumasi airport expansion reconnaisance and report project amongst others.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b> June 2015</b> - He moved to stay permanently in Spain to start a new life. Over there he went to high school again just to learn the language and later enrolled in Teaching English a Foreign Language (TEFL) Certification course which landed him his first job. He went ahead to teach in Academia General Basica de Suboficiales, a spanish military school for officers and sub-officers rank. He served there for two years and worked for some other companies like King's group of companies (KCI). </li>
				<br>
				<li><b>September 2020</b> - He gained scholarship to further his education in MSc. Geodetic Engineering and Robotics with an offer to continue to PhD in any of the specializations. A year later he met his wife who was living in the United States of America and they got married in Ghana. </li>
				<br>				
				<li><b>April 2023</b> / He still continues to live in Spain with he and his wife expecting s bouncing baby boy who will be named Nana Okyere Kwagyan Amankwah Junior...</li>
